## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- React
- TypeScript
- Framer Motion
- CSS
- Tailwind CSS
- Daisy UI library

### What I learned

During this project, I realized that using flexbox was not as convenient for scaling and sizing of text and content as I initially thought. CSS Grid would have been a much better option, especially for responsive design. I was too far into the challenge to redo that part, but it's something I could possibly revisit in the future.

### Continued development

In future projects, I need to focus on running through possible problems when using flexbox. This would have saved me from encountering many smaller issues throughout the development process.
